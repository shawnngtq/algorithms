# Spiral Numbers

Construct a square matrix with a size `N × N` containing integers from `1` to `N * N` in a spiral order, starting from top-left and in clockwise direction.

For `n = 3`, the output should be

```
spiralNumbers(n) = [[1, 2, 3],
                    [8, 9, 4],
                    [7, 6, 5]]
```
