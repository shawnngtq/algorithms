# Sudoku

Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a `9 × 9` grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine `3 × 3` sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from `1 to 9`.

This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

For the first example below, the output should be `true`. For the other grid, the output should be `false`: each of the nine `3 × 3` sub-grids should contain all of the digits from `1 to 9`
